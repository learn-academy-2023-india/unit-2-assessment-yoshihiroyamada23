# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:
a parameter is one where you code for example const insideTheParenthesisIs(parameter) and an argument would be where you define what parameter would be. Example. insideTheParanthesisIs(param1, param2)
Researched answer:
A parameter is one of the variables in a function. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you passed into the method's parameters.
2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer:object have a symbol and a unique identifier. {key:"value}. where a class makes object reusable and has a template or a blueprint or recipe for others.

Researched answer: a class is a template for objects. They define object properties that include valid range of values and a default value. Object is a member of a class.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: something that is repetetive

Researched answer: Occurs when we want to execute code once for each item in a collection, usually elements in an array or properties of an object.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: The process whereby the interpreter appeares to move the declaration of functions, variables, classes, or imports to the top of their scope, prior execution of the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: React state is used to store data within a react component. Data stored in state is available to the entire react component. useState() is method specific to react that defines a variable and its initial vallue as well as creating a method that can be called to update that value as needed.

2. React Props:Props (properties) are specialized React objects used to pass information from one component to another. Props create a unidirectional flow of data and behavior from one component down to a nested component via the component invocation. While state values are constantly updated through user interactions, props cannot be changed. They are a "read only" value.

3. JSX: Javascript XML- marriage of JavaScript and HTML, JSX is what is returned from what is returned from every component, allows us to insert JavaScript logic to the markup.
